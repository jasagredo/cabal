Error: [Cabal-7107]
Could not resolve dependencies:
[__0] trying: foo-0.1.0.0 (user goal)
[__1] trying: foo:*test
[__2] next goal: time (dependency of foo)
[__2] rejecting: time-<VERSION>/installed-<HASH> (conflict: foo *test => time<0)
[__2] fail (backjumping, conflict set: foo, time, foo:test)
After searching the rest of the dependency tree exhaustively, these were the goals I've had most trouble fulfilling: foo (4), foo:test (3), time (2)
